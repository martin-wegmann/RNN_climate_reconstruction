# RNN for field reconstruction

Currently, this is the repository for the code of the publication XXXXXX

The code is split into three Jupyter Notebooks:

1)  preprocess_netcdf_RNN_public.ipynb 

This Notebook deals with processing the raw netcdf input data in order for them to be used for training.

2)  LSTM_MPIGE_nonrandom_4git.ipynb
 
This notebook contains the sampling of the data and the RNN architecture and its execution.

3)  postprocess_netcdf_RNN_public.ipynb

This Notebook deals with processing the output of the RNN in order to be compared to other netcdf datasets.
